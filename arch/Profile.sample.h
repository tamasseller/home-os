/**
 * Hardware profile documentation sample.
 *
 * There is a common interface for the hardware dependent code,
 * whose requirements must be satisfied by compatible ports.
 *
 * The availability of the methods of the platform interface
 * depend on the execution context, there are three of them:
 *
 *  - Task context, regular application task code;
 *  - System calls (synchronous and asynchronous).
 *  - Interrupt context, interrupts of the application code;
 *
 * Involuntary switching between these contexts can occur only
 * in the following ways:
 *
 *  - Tasks can be preempted by system calls, regular interrupt
 *    and also by other Tasks. Task mode can be entered only
 *    through system call context.
 *  - System calls can only be preempted by regular interrupts,
 *    but neither tasks nor other system calls. System call
 *    context can be entered in two ways, through a direct
 *    syscall from task mode or an asynchronous syscall
 *    dispatch request, that can be triggered from any contexts.
 *  - Regular interrupts can do whatever the platform defines,
 *    the scheduler has nothing to do about them.
