/**
 * Limited concurrency, lock-free intrusive binary search tree
 * ===========================================================
 *
 * This container can be accessed for searching and updating
 * concurrently in scenarios where there is only one writer
 * and readers can preempt the writer only but not vice-versa.
 *
 * How it works
 * ------------
 *
 * This property is achieved by having a stable snapshot that
 * is atomically updated at the end of the update procedures.
 * Each node contains two set of left and right pointers and
 * no parent pointer. The tree contains two root pointers and
 * a selector field, which determines which one is active.
 * The first root only ever points to the first set of child
 * pointers and the second points to the second. Also child
 * pointers keep the same grouping, so there are two entirely
 * separate trees implemented in a single set of elements.
 *
 *            --------------------------
 *           | root1 | root2 | selector |
 *            --------------------------
 *      ______/             \__________
 *     /                               \
 *    -------------------     -------------------
 *   | l1 | r1 | l2 | r2 |   | l1 | r1 | l2 | r2 |
 *    -------------------     -------------------
 *           \         \  ______________/
 *            \         \/
 *             -------------------
 *            | l1 | r1 | l2 | r2 |
 *             -------------------
 *
 * Readers need to use the selector to determine which root
 * can be used as the starting point for traversal. The
 * writer uses the active root as a starting point for its
 * operations too, but only modifies the inactive root and
 * the inactive set of child pointers in the nodes. Once
 * it is done with building the updated tree it flips the
 * selector (which is atomic operation by nature) and the
 * readers see the new tree.
 *
 * Operations
 * ----------
 *
 * Lookup is done in the same way as for any binary search
 * tree, update operations are based on the Day-Stout-Warren
 * algorithm. The tree is normalized by flattening it into
 * a degenerate form, where all no node has left child, that
 * is the whole tree becomes a singly linked list, with the
 * right pointer pointing to the next element. Then this
 * structure (called a vine in the original paper) is
 * transformer into a fully balanced binary tree via regular
 * tree rotation operations.
 *
 * Concurrency
 * -----------
 *
 * Because only readers can preempt the writer, they can
 * only observe the same active root while searching the
 * tree. If a write operation is preempted, its changes
 * are invisible to the readers because they are carried
 * out on the hidden spare part of the nodes and the
 * inactive root.
 *
 * Characteristics
 * ---------------
 *
 * It has a O(n) time complexity for mutation and O(log(n))
 * for search, also it is optimally balanced in contrast with
 * common self-balancing (AVL, red-black, etc.) trees that
 * only approximate the optimal structure.
 *
 * The update operations require minimal, constant additional
 * space, allocated on the stack. The second, inactive set of
 * pointers are used as scratch area for various operations,
 * including building the new, updated tree structure.
 *
 * These properties make this container ideal for applications,
 * where updates are rare but lookups are frequent and can be
 * triggered by a source that is completely non-synchronized
 * with the writer.
